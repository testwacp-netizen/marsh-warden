      "content": "**Overview:** Wastewater reuse is widely practiced globally, particularly in agriculture, with significant scale in developing regions where untreated or partially treated wastewater irrigates millions of hectares, far exceeding treated wastewater use[Source 1].\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Untreated or partially treated wastewater irrigates up to 35 million hectares globally, primarily in the global South [Source 1].\n\n• Treated wastewater reuse occurs at a scale thirty times smaller than untreated wastewater irrigation [Source 1].\n\n• The Middle East and North Africa region has documented cases of water reuse for urban landscaping, golf courses, and public irrigation perimeters [Source 4].\n\n• Guidelines exist to improve acceptance and governance of agricultural water reuse, addressing obstacles and best practices [Source 5].\n\n**Implications:**\n• Policies must prioritize safe reuse frameworks to mitigate health risks from untreated wastewater irrigation [Source 1].\n• Scaling treated wastewater reuse requires investment in treatment infrastructure and harmonized governance [Source 5].\n\n| **Practice** | **Scale (Hectares)** | **Region** |\n|--------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Untreated/partially treated wastewater irrigation | ~35 million | Global South |\n| Treated wastewater irrigation | ~1.17 million | Global |\n\nWhat specific aspect of wastewater reuse are you most interested in, such as agricultural applications, treatment technologies, or regional case studies?",

          "content": "Reuse of raw or diluted wastewater for irrigation of ﬁeld crops is practiced around most cities of the global South on a total area of up to 35 million hectares (Raschid-Sally and Jayakody, 2008; Thebo et al., 2017). Most of this irrigation is using untreated or at best partially treated wastewater, at a thirty times larger scale than the known areas using treated wastewater (Scott et al., 2010); Thebo et al., 2017.",
